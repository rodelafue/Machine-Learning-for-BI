    "\n",
    "The simplest definition of a neural network, more properly referred to as an 'artificial' neural network (ANN), is provided by the inventor of one of the first neurocomputers, Dr. Robert Hecht-Nielsen. He defines a neural network as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"...a computing system made up of a number of simple, highly interconnected processing elements, which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "** The Basics of Neural Networks** \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural neworks, shown in Fig1, are typically organized in layers. Layers are made up of a number of interconnected 'nodes' which contain an 'activation function'. Patterns are presented to the network via the 'input layer', which communicates to one or more 'hidden layers' where the actual processing is done via a system of weighted 'connections'. The hidden layers then link to an 'output layer' where the Most ANNs contain some form of 'learning rule' which modifies the weights of the connections according to the input patterns that it is presented with. In a sense, ANNs learn by example as do their biological counterparts; a child learns to recognize dogs from examples of dogs [1]."

    "A neural network is basically a sequence of operations applied to a matrix of input data. These operations are usually collections of additions and multiplications followed by applications of non-linear functions. The important trick with neural networks is called backpropagation. Back propagation is a procedure that allows us to update the model variables based on the learning rate and the output of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation, short for \"backward propagation of errors,\" is an algorithm for supervised learning of artificial neural networks using gradient descent. Given an artificial neural network and an error function, the method calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network's weights. It is a generalization of the delta rule for perceptrons to multilayer feedforward neural networks. The \"backwards\" part of the name stems from the fact that calculation of the gradient proceeds backwards through the network, with the gradient of the final layer of weights being calculated first and the gradient of the first layer of weights being calculated last. Partial computations of the gradient from one layer are reused in the computation of the gradient for the previous layer. This backwards flow of the error information allows for efficient computation of the gradient at each layer versus the naive approach of calculating the gradient of each layer separately [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important feature to take note of in neural networks is the non-linear activation function. Since most neural networks are just combinations of addition and multiplication operations, they will not be able to model non-linear datasets. To address this issue, we have used the non-linear activation functions in the neural networks. This will allow the neural network to adapt to most non-linear situations.\n",

    "** Optimization Algorithm **\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Adam optimization** algorithm is an extension to stochastic gradient descent. Adam is an optimization algorithm that can used instead of the classical stochastic gradient descent procedure to update network weights iterative based in training data. Adam was presented by Diederik Kingma from OpenAI and Jimmy Ba from the University of Toronto in their 2015 ICLR paper (poster) titled “Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization“. \n",
    "\n",
    "- How Does Adam Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam is different to classical stochastic gradient descent.Stochastic gradient descent maintains a single learning rate (termed alpha) for all weight updates and the learning rate does not change during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors describe Adam as combining the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad)** that maintains a per-parameter learning rate that improves performance on problems with sparse gradients (e.g. natural language and computer vision problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp)** that also maintains per-parameter learning rates that are adapted based on the average of recent magnitudes of the gradients for the weight (e.g. how quickly it is changing). This means the algorithm does well on online and non-stationary problems (e.g. noisy).\n",
    "Adam realizes the benefits of both AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of adapting the parameter learning rates based on the average first moment (the mean) as in RMSProp, Adam also makes use of the average of the second moments of the gradients (the uncentered variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the algorithm calculates an exponential moving average of the gradient and the squared gradient, and the parameters beta1 and beta2 control the decay rates of these moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial value of the moving averages and beta1 and beta2 values close to 1.0 (recommended) result in a bias of moment estimates towards zero. This bias is overcome by first calculating the biased estimates before then calculating bias-corrected estimates [3]. More details [4,5].\n"

    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are are a special kind of multi-layer neural networks. They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer. However, ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network [8]. Therefore, they can recognize patterns with extreme variability (such as handwritten characters), and with robustness to distortions and simple geometric transformations [9]. CNNs have various architectures: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet and etc. Here, LENET-5 one of the simplest architectures is considered to make a prediction the sign languge. \n",

Stride is normally set in a way so that the output volume is an integer and not a fraction. Let’s look at an example. Let’s imagine a 7 x 7 input volume, a 3 x 3 filter (Disregard the 3rd dimension for simplicity), and a stride of 2. So, as you can see, the receptive field is shifting by 2 units now and the output volume shrinks as well. Notice that if we tried to set our stride to 3, then we’d have issues with spacing and making sure the receptive fields fit on the input volume. Normally, programmers will increase the stride if they want receptive fields to overlap less and if they want smaller spatial dimensions."

As we keep applying conv layers, the size of the volume will decrease faster than we would like. In the early layers of our network, we want to preserve as much information about the original input volume so that we can extract those low level features. Let’s say we want to apply the same conv layer but we want the output volume to remain 32 x 32 x 3. To do this, we can apply a zero padding of size 2 to that layer.

The ability to process higher resolution images requires larger and more convolutional layers, so this technique is constrained by the availability of computing resources [10]. For example, leNet-5 Start with an image of 32 x 32 x 1 and goal was to recognize handwritten digit. In the first step we use six 5 x 5 filter with stride 1 and get 28 x 28 x 6. With stride of 1 and no padding we reduce the dimension to 32 x 32 to 28 x 28. Then we use a average pooling with a filter width of 2 and stride of 2 and reduce the dimension by factor of 2 and end up with 14 x 14 x 6. Then we use another convolutional layer with sixteen 5 x 5 filter and end up with 10 x 10 x 16. That time people use valid padding that’s why each time height and weight shrinks. Then another pooling layer and end up with 5 x 5 x 16. Then the next layer is a fully connected layer with 120 nodes. The previous layers 400 (5*5*16) then connected with this 120 neurons. Then another layer this 120 nodes connected with a 84 node and use this to connected with Yhat with possible 10 values that will recognize digit from 0 to 9. But in modern version of this neural net we use softmax function with a ten wave classification output [11]."
